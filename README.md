# üåê B2B Invoice Management Application


---



## üóíÔ∏è Introduction to B2B Operations

The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other businesses on credit. When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same. This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. This is known in accounting terminology as ‚ÄúAccounts Receivable‚Äù.


**‚ÄúAccounts Receivable represents money owed by entities to the firm on the
sale of products or services on credit. In most business entities, accounts
receivable is typically executed by generating an invoice and either mailing
or electronically delivering it to the customer, who, in turn, must pay it within
an established timeframe, called credit terms or payment terms.‚Äù**


Seller business interacts with various businesses and sells goods to all of them
at various times. Hence, the seller business needs to keep track of the total
amount it owes from all the buyers. This involves keeping track of all invoices
from all the buyers. Each invoice will have various important fields like a
payment due date, invoice date, invoice amount, baseline date etc.

## About the application

- In the ideal world, the buyer business should payback within the stipulated time (i.e. the Payment Term). However, in the real world, the buyer business seldom pays within their established time frame, and this is where the Account receivables Department comes into picture.
- Every business consists of a dedicated Account receivables Department to collect and track payment of invoices.
- It consists of a Account receivables team that is responsible for:
    - Collecting payments from customers for their past due invoices.
    - Sending reminders and follow ups to the customers for payments to be made.
    - Looking after the entire process of getting the cash inflow.
    - Help the company get paid for the services and products supplied.
<!-- - Build a Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it gets created in the system.
- Build a full stack Invoice Management Application -->

## Problem Statement ‚ùì

### Machine Learning :

A web application where the users in the Account Receivable department can :

- View the invoice data from various buyers.
- See various fields/attributes of the invoice(s) from a particular buyer.
- Perform Data Pre-processing on the invoice data.
- Get account-level analytics to easily visualize and interpret data- EDA and
Feature Engineering.
- Get a prediction of when the invoice is going to get paid.

### Web Application :

The objective of the Web Application Development is:

- To build a Full-stack Invoice Management Application using ReactJs, JDBC, Java, Servlets, MySql, Flask.
- Build a responsive Receivables Dashboard.
- Visualize Data in the form of grids.
- Predict the payment date using flask.
- Analyse Data in the form of graphs.
- Perform Searching operations on the invoices.
- Add & Edit data in the editable fields of the grid.
- Delete data of selected rows in predefined templates.

2. **Advanced Search** - A pop-up window, which depicts the illustration that enables the user to search with single or multiple parameter values from the grid.
3. **Predict** - The predict button is used as a tool to predict the Payment Date of each invoice using flask and python.
4. **Analytics** - The analytics button is used to give analysis of data in a graphical representation.
5. **Refresh** - The refresh button is used to refresh the data and fetch the most recent dataset in the dashboard of the app.
